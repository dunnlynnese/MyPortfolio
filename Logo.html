<h1>Fictitious Business Logo</h1>


<br></br>
<img src="Assignment 3_ver_3.pdf" alt="ver_3" width = "500" height = "500">
 
<p>For this project, my team and I decided that we would like to create a nursing school logo. 
The logo was an axolotl, as axolotls symbolize heath and healing. The colors we chose were green and pink because green represents health and pink is the same.</p>
<p>This logo was meant to truly accentuates the colors of green and pink while still keeping the silhouettes of the axolotls. </p>

<img src="Assignment 3.pdf" alt="ver_3" width = "500" height = "500">

<p>This variant of the logo is created with putting the color inside of the axolotls with a white back ground and the letters in black.</p>

<img src="Assignment 3_ver_2.pdf" alt="ver_3" width = "500" height = "500">
<p>This last variant has the pink and green in the letters to make it look like it has a shine within the letters. The axolotls are black which puts weight into the imagery of the nursing mascot.</p>
